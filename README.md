# Jurassic-Park-Dinosaurs-Detector
Jurassic Park 47 dinosaurs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with Tensorflow on images of dinosaurs from Bing.

# Website

The model is hosted via Streamlit here: TODO

# Demonstration
Here is a quick demonstration of the website and model predictions TODO

# Dataset

I wrote and used the script `dinos_downloader.py` which downloads images from Bing to create my own custom dataset of 47 species of dinosaurs. The dataset can be found here: TODO

I cleaned the downloaded images both automatically (also in `dinos_downloader.py`) and manually (to get rid of nonsense images) and the result is 4364 images of 47 different species of dinosaurs that are known to appear in the Jurassic Park movies.
